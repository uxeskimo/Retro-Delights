A set of posters of Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered game have been removed in a recent patch when using the visual mode option.

The pinup posters were in Tomb Raider 3 and located in the 'Sleeping with the Fishes' level and were looked upon as a easter egg to find in the game.

Fans need not worry, it looks like the removal could of been a mistake, the developer has said they were "inadvertently removed" and will be put back in a future update.
