There is no doubting how great the Playstation 1 console was, produced by Sony, released in Japan in 1994 and 1995 for the rest of the world, it was the first console to sell over 100 million units.

It would be another five years before the Sony Playstation 2 was released, in that time we saw the Playstation one produce some of the greatest video games we've ever seen.


## 10. Tekken 3

Starting off with a fighting game, the thrid in the Tekken series, Tekken 3 was developed and published by Namco and released in 1998.

Tekken 3 was ported from the arcade version and had all the modes and then some, it pushed the playstation to its limits, you had two punch and kick buttons and move left and right with some great 2d backgrounds.

A 2000 release, Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2 was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision as a followup to the successful Tony Hawk's Pro Skater which was released in just the previous year.

Easy to pick up and play, it had a stong mix of simulation and arcade, with a focus of trying pull off trick, it was fun and also accompnaied by a brilliant sound track.

The pro evo series was the number one football simulator before Fifa rose to fame and Pro Evo we'nt to pot.

Why was it so good? Becuase it felt like real football, the passing, the tackles, the shooting, each player would have their strengths and weaknesses and you could craft a goal in so many creative ways.

The Pro Evo series will hold fond memories in a lot of retro players hearts with the Playstation One showing how good a football game could be.

## 5. Metal Gear Solid

Hideo Kojima was the mastermind behind Metal Gear Solid, which was developed and published by Konami and released in 1998.

You took control of Solid Snake who navigating his way around a nuclear weapons facility, with the goal not to be detected by terrosit outfit FOXHOUND. 

Snake had to use his abilities and the enviroment around him to stay undetected, it was an orgianl idea full of suprises along the way.

## 4. Silent Hill

In 1999 we saw the first installent of the Silent Hill series, a game developed by Team Silent and pubished by Konami.

You played the character Harry Mason, his wife had died and he was grieving and goes on a vacation with his adopted daughter Cheryl to the town of Silient Hill.

Driving on route to Silent Hill, Harry is left unconcious as he vaoids hitting a girl in the road, he wakes to find Cheryl has gone and on foot walks into the mysterios town of Silent hill.

Silent hill was a survival horror game, it involved solving puzzles, combatting the many horrors of the game and exploration, it has a unique eeiries feel which really did create a terryifying atmoshphere.

Following the success of the orginal game, Gran Turismo 2 was developed by Polyphony Digital and released in 1999 by Sony Computer Enterainmnet and was the ultimate driving simulator which improved on its predecessor.

In Gran Turismo 2 you had a wealth of cars and options you could configure, the modes to play in could be arcade or if you wanted to get more serious similuation mode really brought out the options to configure and really got into yhte dynamics of racing a car.


## 2. Tombraider

Laura Croft the archaeologist adventurer came to the Playstation back in 1996 when Eiidos released it (Core design developed it) to much aclaim.

Tombraider was an action adventure game which at its core was about solving puzzles and a bit of action in between, one of the first games to be fully 3D you could walk, run, jump, climb onto ledges and across them, you jump into water and swim, you could interact with your enviroment.

Laura croft became an iconic games figure and the tombraiders series is still going strong today.


## 1. Final Fantasy VII

This wasn't difficult for me, Final Fantasy VII had it all and then some, an absolute classic and way ahead of its time when Square developed it and Sony Computer Enterainmnet released it back in 1997.

What was good about it? You we're taken on a journey, an epic journey (over 3 CD's) with a unique set of characters that you grew to care about as the story unfolds and you learnt more about their pasts.

Final Fantasy VII was a turned based rpg wehere you would control different members of the story prgressing the games main mission, on the way you would talk to people, do sidequests, have battles and continue to build up the characters.

The score that accomponies the game is my favourite score of any game, Nobuo Uematsu worked majic witH it, the gamne wouldnt be the samne without it, its a beautiful score.

Final Fantasy VII was easily the best Playstation One game in my eyes, arguable the greatest video game of all time (thats a discussion for a different day), what a legacy this amazing close left behind.
