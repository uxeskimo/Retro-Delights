A warm welcome to Retro Delights in the first post on our brand new website!

I’m Lee Murray and in partnership with Alex Murray we have set up Retro Delights to create quality content on retro games and products.

We’re both passionate about retro gaming and retro stuff in general, so why not join us on our journey to become the number 1 retro gaming brand in the UK.

So this is the very start of Retro Delights, we’re learning as we go, the only rule we have set is to have fun creating, what we hope to be delightful retro content.

Lee and Alex Murray.
