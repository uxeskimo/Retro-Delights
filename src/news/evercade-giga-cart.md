Today Evercade announced a new cartridge, the Giga Cart, which will hold bigger and more modern retro games with its larger capacity.

We've got the Evercade XP and Super Pockets which are great, the new Giga Cart is the same shape as existing cartridges so will work with current devices.

## More modern Retro Games

Evercade have said the new cartridge is for larger modern retro games that we're released on consoles, which is promising.

Giga Carts will cost £22.49, which seems fair considering the extra storage and not much of an increase from the £17.99 of the normal cartridges.

## Two Giga Carts coming in 2024

More good news is we will have two Giga Cart releases in 2024, so will keep our eyes peeled for what game collection will come with the initial releases.

Evercade is developing its offerings with the Giga Cart a good example of this, what a time to be a retro gamer!
