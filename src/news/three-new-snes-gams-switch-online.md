From today, if you have a Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Online, you will be able to play three classic SNES games!

The games are:

- Amazing Hebereke
- Super R-Type
- Wrecking Crew 98

## Amazing Hebereke

Released in 1994 and developed by Sunsoft in Japan, this was a fighting-style spin-off to the Hebereke series, which you could play in single-player or up to four players.

## Super R-Type

R-Type needs no introduction, released in 1991, this classic shooter was based on the arcade version of R-Type 2, taking some of the levels from that and adding new ones as well.


## Wrecking Crew 98

The sequel to Wrecking Crew came out in 1998 and featured Mario and Bowser in a game that was around puzzles in a [Tetris](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Game-Boy/TETRIS--275924.html) and [Puyo Puyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyo_Puyo) style.

## Nintendo Switch Online & Expansion Pack
We think Nintendo Switch Online offers good value, for retro gamers, the expansion pack unlocks even more retro games to play, for more info on what you get with membership, have a look at [Nintendo's website](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-Switch-Online/Membership-options/Membership-options-1374627.html).
