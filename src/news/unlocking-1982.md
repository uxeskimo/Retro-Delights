Ben Jones, the commercial director of PLAION REPLAI has said: 

“These games aren’t just nostalgic releases, they’re cultural touchstones. With GALAGA as our flagship, and PAC-MAN, Dig Dug, and Xevious completing the set, we’re celebrating 1982 as the year that defined the golden age of arcades.  We want fans old and new to unlock that moment in time and experience it all over again on Atari consoles”
