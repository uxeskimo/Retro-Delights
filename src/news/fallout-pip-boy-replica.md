I was introduced to the fallout series with the third instalment, Fallout 3 on the Playstation 3 when it was released back in 2008.

Starting off in the underground vault 101, creating a character and heading off into the post apocalyptic world gripped me.

Survival in this dark world depended on a few things, most notably the Pip-Boy 3000, a wearable personal information processor (PIP), worn on your left arm in the game and central to you developing your character.

## A Die Cast 1-1 Replica from Bethesda

Bethesda have created a Pip Boy Die Cast 1-1 Replica which is based on the Pip Boy seen in the new Fallout Amazon Prime TV series.

The front casing is made from die-cast metal, is wearable with a foam inset to make it more comfortable on the arm and has a functioning TFT LCD screen.

This replica looks a big improvement over the pip boy that came with the Fallout 4 game limited edition release back in 2015.
