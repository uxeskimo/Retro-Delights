My Arcade’s Atari Game Station Go handheld looks a decent offering, especially if you’re an Atari fan (like me) or a retro gaming fan in general (also like me).

It comes pre-loaded with over 200 classic Atari titles from the 2600, 5200, 7900, some arcade classics and 5 games from Atari's Recharged series.

It has a 7 inch display, HDMI-out (so you can play on your TV), USB-C charging, microSD, blue tooth, Wi-Fi and a rechargeable battery with up to 4- 5 hours per charge. 

My Arcade have gone all out with the controls with an integrated paddle, trak-ball and keypad, this should help to get the most from the games on offer.

It could be a tricky one to get hold of in the UK and will cost a small fortune in shipping, let’s hope we get a stockist over here.

[First reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI8kkDxZns8) look promising, it could be worth the wait, for more info on the Gamestation Go have a look at [Atari's website](https://atari.com/products/atari-gamestation-go?srsltid=AfmBOoqBkRFRPctWs3k9auL3mMmw7rvmalAoAh6qVIaC5T0mQjh6jouo).
