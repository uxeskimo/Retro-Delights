## It started in the 80's

<p class="drop-cap">It was around 1984, I would of been about 9 years of age, at that time my family lived on a council estate in a place called '7 ways' in Stretford, Manchester.

At the top of our road we had a row of shops, your typical, a corner shop that sells a bit of everything, a hair-dressers, a chippy but the stand-out for me was the newsagents.


## The magazine rack

Whenever I ventured into the newsagents I would head straight over to the magazine rack and look for the video game section.

My only experience of playing video games at this point was in arcades on family trips to Blackpool and Cornwall but now video games were well established in peoples homes.

## Video games in the home

Because of the massive popularity of video games, magazines about them we're also flying off the shelves, for me as a 9 year old, the pages ignited my imagination of what the games we're like to play.

## More creativity

I think there has alway been something special about the written paper format and the possibilities it brings, to many times in digital we go for functional, tried and tested, we see ‘samey’ designs all over the web and less creativity than the in paper format.

I think digital is getting better though and keeps evolving, the new CSS grid is now widely support by web browsers and it does open up more possibilities with more advanced designs on websites and more opportunities for creativity.

## A passion ignited

Going back to those early years, I really did look forward to looking at the magazines to see the latest computer and video games that had come out.

In later life I ended up choosing design as my career but from an early age I had an appreciation of the use of type, colour, illustrations, game screenshots and art directed stories which help bring the games to life for me.
