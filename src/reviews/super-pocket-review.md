Imagine having a device that fitted in your pocket and allowed you to play over 500 retro games back in the 80’s, damn.

In 2024, this is commonplace, the latest, the Super Pocket, lets you do that for under fifty quid, but is it any good?

## Introduction

Super pockets are an Evercade product, which means out-of-the-box compatibility with over 500+ game cartridges, that's not a bad start.

The initial releases come in two editions, Taito and Capcom each have pre-installed games from the publisher.

The launch price is £49.99 for each edition.

## Design

I’m a designer by trade, I have high standards, and the super pocket exceeded my expectations.

For the price point, It's a lovely thing to look at, the first two releases each bring a modern, chunky, but simple look.

The colours are bold and vibrant, Capcom comes in blue and yellow, and Taito green and black (I prefer the Taito colours).

It’s a good size, 10.46 x 1.09 x 16.81cm and weighing in at 90.72g, it's true to its name and will fit in your pocket.

They charge by USB-C (cable included), with each charge giving you 4+ hours of play, they also have a 3.5mm headphone jack.

## Screen and sound

The screen is 7.112cm in size and 320px by 240px resolution. It’s bright with decent colours, and it does the job.

It's all about compromise with the size and resolution of the screen; some games will look sharp, some less so, but all in all, it works well.

The sound was louder than expected and packs a punch, the catchy Bubble Bobble soundtrack on the Taito edition sounded great.

## Controls

Controls feel nice in the hand; you have a D-pad, four face buttons, as well as start, select and menu buttons.

There are back buttons as well, which give flexibility to more advanced games in the future.

The back buttons do feel a bit cramped; there's no getting away from this, though, because of the size of the device.

## Games

I was drawn to the Taito edition. First, it comes preinstalled with 18 games:

- Bubble Bobble
- Space Invaders 
- Space Invaders 91'
- Operation Wolf
- The New Zealand Story
- Rastan 
- Puzzle Bobble
- Cadash
- Chack'n Pop
- Don Doko Don
- Elevator Action
- The Fairyland Story
- Football Champ
- Growl
- Kiki Kaikai
- The Legend of Kage
- Liquid Kids
- Volified


I started with Bubble Bobble, it played well and was an enjoyable experience. On the other hand, Operation Wolf was a weird one. A light gun game on a small handheld is not a great match. Still, it brought back nostalgia.

Space Invaders on this screen is always going to be a compromised play. For me, it’s OK, and I like having such a classic to be able to pick up and try to beat my highest score.

Other standouts for me on this list are The New Zealand Story, Puzzle Bobble, Elevator Action and Rastan.

The Capcom edition comes with 12 pre-installed games:

- 1942
- 1943
- 1944: The Loop Master
- Bionic Commando
- Captain Commando
- Street Fighter II’: Hyper Fighting
- Strider
- Wolf of the Battlefield: Mercs
- Mega man
- Final Fight
- Ghouls ‘N Ghosts
- Forgotten Worlds

On this edition, I was straight into Ghouls ‘N Ghosts, this looks good and plays well, although it's still rock-hard!

Mega Man had bypassed me back in the day; this was the first time I’d played it, it was enjoyable on the Super Pocket.

The 1942 games are vertical shooters, so obviously, they don’t look as great on the small screen but are still playable.

Street Fighter II’ and Bionic Commando are also stellar games, although there are not as many games in this edition, it is still an impressive selection.

## Verdict
For under £50, the super pockets offer good value; the massive 500+ Evercade cartridge library brings a unique angle.

Yes, there are better handhelds out there, but these don't play official roms, so no faff out of-the-box retro gaming with the Super Pockets.
